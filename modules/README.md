# Modules
A readme for specifying how modules should be constructed.

## Required exported functions
A module needs to export the following functions:
- `name`: Prints name of module
- `version`: Prints a version string of module
- `transforms`: Print a list of transformations that the module can perform and their arguments, formatted as: 
  TODO: fix
- `_start` This is the entrypoint, usually called main. TODO: add about how it should work
