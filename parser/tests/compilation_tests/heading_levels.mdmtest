Testing headings of different levels. Seven consecutive hashtags
is not allowed and should therefore be parsed as a paragraph.

```mdm
# Level 1

## Level 2

### Level 3

####### paragraph text
```

```json
{
    "name": "Document",
    "children": [
        {
            "name": "Heading1",
            "children": [
                "Level 1"
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Heading2",
            "children": [
                "Level 2"
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Heading3",
            "children": [
                "Level 3"
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Paragraph",
            "children": [
                "####### paragraph text"
            ]
        }
    ]
