```mdm
This is a simple paragraph.
It should be easy to parse.
It contains a couple of hard
breaks
```

```json
{
    "name": "Document",
    "children": [
        {
            "name": "Paragraph",
            "children": [
                "This is a simple paragraph.\nIt should be easy to parse.\nIt contains a couple of hard\nbreaks"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
