Testing headings of different levels. Seven consecutive hashtags
is not allowed and should therefore be parsed as a paragraph.

```mdm
This is a paragraph.
# and this is part of the paragraph
instead of a heading.

# Heading
Using headings and paragraphs like
this is allowed.

# Headings work in the same manner with modules
[module]
This actually creates a multiline invocation
of the module.
