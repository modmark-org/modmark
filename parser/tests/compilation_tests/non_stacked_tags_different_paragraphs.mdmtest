Here are some simple tests for flat (non-stacked).
The content of each tag is misspelled intentionally so if the parser
for some reason uses the tag name as the body, it will be caught.
Each example tests something extra as well:
1. Whitespace on both sides of the tag should be preserved
2. Whitespace on right should be preserved, while removed from the other side
3. Whitespace on left side should be preserved, and removed from the other side
4. Tags at start of lines should work
5. Tags at end of lines should work
6. Tags on a single line should work
7. Tags should be parsed as soon as possible (first two `~~` is tags, third `~` is after the tag)
8. Escaped tags should work (only very first and very last `~~` should parse as tags)

Every row is in its own paragraph
