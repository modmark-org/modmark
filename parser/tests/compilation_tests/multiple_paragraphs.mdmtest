Testing parsing of two paragraphs.
Note that some newlines are escaped, while
some are not. In the second example,
note that there is a space between the first
and second line, and the second and
third line (right behind the backslash),
while between the third and forth line,
there isn't a space.

```mdm
This is the first paragraph \
of the document. Slashes \
are used to escape new-\
lines.

This is the second paragraph.
Here, escaped newlines are \
used sometimes, while sometimes
not
```

```json
{
    "name": "Document",
    "children": [
        {
            "name": "Paragraph",
            "children": [
                "This is the first paragraph of the document. Slashes are used to escape new-lines."
            ]
        },
        
        {
            "name": "Paragraph",
            "children": [
                "This is the second paragraph.\nHere, escaped newlines are used sometimes, while sometimes\nnot"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
