Tests behaviour of parser when combining headings, paragraphs and modules

```mdm
This is a paragraph.
# and this is part of the paragraph
instead of a heading.

# Heading
Using headings and paragraphs like this works.

# Headings work in the same manner with modules
[module]
This actually creates a multiline invocation
of the module.
```
